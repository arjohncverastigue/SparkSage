The existing commands (`/ask`, `/clear`, `/summarize`, `/provider`) have been successfully refactored out of `bot.py` and into separate cog files (`cogs/general.py` and `cogs/summarize.py`).

The `bot.py` file has been simplified to only contain event handlers and cog loading logic. The `get_history` and `ask_ai` utility functions were also moved into the `SparkSageBot` class as methods.

The user has verified that all refactored commands are working identically, confirming the success of the refactoring.
